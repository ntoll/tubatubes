Two Tuba Tunes
==============

blazhevich.mp3 - Vladislav Blazhevich wrote his 70 studies for BBflat Tuba in the early years of the 20th century. This particular study is the final section of number 23 in D major ~ Andante sostenuto (sustained and at a walking pace). It's a particularly "Tuba-y" piece: rather podgy yet thoughtful in mood.

minuet.mp3 - J.S.Bach wrote 6 suites for Violoncello. This is a recording of the second minuet of the first suite in G. It's a nice opportunity to show of the flexibility of the tuba in its higher registers and perform a piece written by a master composer.

These recordings were made in my small(ish) music room using a really bad microphone and the Audacity audio editing suite running on Debian Linux.

Enjoy..!
